# 0004: Isolate Modal staging and prod with separate workspaces, not Team-plan service users

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-10-28
- **Author:** @anthonythanpoovong
- **Deciders:** @anthonythanpoovong
- **Related:** #320, #302, #163, #300
- **Supersedes:**

## Context

Workers run on Modal (Key Decision: "Heavy processing runs on Modal GPU workers"). `deploy.yml` needs to deploy to staging automatically and to prod on a manual run, and a staging job must never be able to touch prod (#163, #320).

The constraint is the Modal **Starter** plan. It has no service users, so the only token is a user token that covers the whole workspace. A staging job holding it could deploy to `prod`, and the `staging` and `prod` environments we created don't change that. Scoped service users (Contributor on one environment) need the **Team** plan, $250/month plus compute (modal.com/pricing). PR #302 is written for service users and is on hold until this is decided.

What we've verified (2026-10-27/28):
- Modal's docs say API tokens are added per workspace, and that users can belong to several workspaces.
- Starter can create a second workspace once a payment method is added. The dashboard says it unlocks workspace creation and the full $30 credit, and charges $0.50 to verify the card, which is refunded.
- Modal's [budgets docs](https://modal.com/docs/guide/budgets) say a workspace **spend limit** is a hard stop on net out-of-pocket charges (after credits), settable by Owners and Managers. Environment-level budgets need Team. Not yet confirmed in our dashboards (see Open questions).
- We now own two workspaces, `anthonythanpoovong` and `editrace-app`, both as Owner.
- Cost is the main constraint. We have no users, no revenue and no worker deployed yet.

Why now: the first real worker deploy (#7) is blocked until the isolation layout is chosen.

## Options considered

### Option A: A separate Modal workspace per environment, one token each
- `editrace-app` is prod and `anthonythanpoovong` is staging for now. Each GitHub environment (`staging`, `Production`) holds only its own workspace's token. In Modal terms the environments are the workspaces.
- ✅ Hard isolation. A staging token has no access to the prod workspace at all, not just a role boundary.
- ✅ Separate spend caps per workspace, so a staging runaway can't use the prod budget.
- ✅ $0 for the workspaces themselves.
- ❌ A card must be on file, so usage past the free credit can be billed.
- ❌ Staging lives under a personal workspace until it moves.
- ❌ #302 and `docs/environments.md` must be reworded, since they assume service users.
- Cost / effort: $0 plus compute; a small rewrite of #302.

### Option B: Upgrade to Team and use service users
- One workspace, `ci-staging` and `ci-prod` service users with Contributor on one environment each.
- ✅ Strong isolation, and #302 works as written.
- ❌ $250/month plus compute, about $3,000 a year, before any user exists.
- Cost / effort: $250/month.

### Option C: One user token for both environments
- ✅ Nothing to set up.
- ❌ No isolation. A leaked token or a bad staging job can deploy to prod. This fails the #163 criterion that a staging deploy never touches prod.
- Cost / effort: $0.

### Option D: Do nothing / defer
- ✅ No spend and no change.
- ❌ Blocks the first real worker deploy (#7) and leaves #163 open.

## Decision

We will **use a separate Modal workspace for each environment, with one API token per workspace**, because it gives hard isolation and separate spend caps for $0, while Team costs $250/month before we have a single user.

- **Prod** is `editrace-app`. **Staging** is `anthonythanpoovong` for now.
- **Nothing is live yet.** No `MODAL_TOKEN_*` secrets are created or added to GitHub until we choose to start spending, so no job can deploy.
- Each workspace gets a **spend limit of $0**, so Modal stops any workload that would create an out-of-pocket charge. The free credit still runs. Raise a limit deliberately, per workspace, when we choose to spend.
- Each workspace uses its default Modal environment (`main`), so the deploy step needs no `--env` flag. This drops the environment layer of defense in depth on purpose: the workspace is the boundary. The unused `prod` environment in `anthonythanpoovong` is deleted so a misdirected staging deploy can't land somewhere dead.
- Each `MODAL_TOKEN_*` pair lives only in its matching GitHub environment, never at repo level. Those environments only accept deployments from `main` (`staging`) and protected branches (`Production`), so a branch workflow can't read them (`docs/environments.md`). Required reviewers aren't available on our GitHub plan.
- @anthonythanpoovong creates both tokens. Starter tokens belong to a person, so they are rotated when anyone who created one leaves or loses access, and the Modal audit log shows that person for every deploy.

## Consequences

- **Good:** a staging token can't reach prod. Each environment has its own budget. No recurring cost now.
- **Bad / accepted trade-offs:** a card is on file, so overage past the credit is possible until the limits are confirmed. Staging sits under a personal workspace, so staging billing and tokens depend on one person's account. Secrets and images are duplicated per workspace. The isolation protects CI tokens, not people: the same login owns both workspaces, so anyone with it can deploy to either from a terminal. Whether the free credit is per workspace is unconfirmed, so we don't count a second credit as budget.
- **One-way or two-way door:** two-way. If we outgrow this, we upgrade to Team and move to service users, revoking the workspace tokens. The cost is a rewrite of the deploy step and docs, with no data migration. Moving staging to its own workspace later changes the workspace name in every staging endpoint URL, so keep any staging URL in configuration (env vars or Modal client lookups), never hardcoded in code, webhooks or docs.
- **Follow-up work:**
  - Convert #302 back to a draft now, then reword it. It already moves `MODAL_TOKEN_*` to environment secrets, so only the service-user wording and the `--env` flags change.
  - Update `docs/environments.md`: workspaces and one token per environment, and remove the duplicated `MODAL_TOKEN_*` row that says "repo secrets".
  - Set the spend limits and update the Modal row in `docs/observability.md`.
  - Move staging to its own workspace when we first add a teammate to staging or before launch, whichever comes first.
  - Add tokens only when we're ready to spend (#320).
- **Affected:** no schema, DB, RLS or MCP changes. Cost: $0 now. Docs: `environments.md`, `observability.md`, #302.

## How we'll know

- Before this ADR is accepted: a throwaway token created in `anthonythanpoovong` cannot list or deploy in `editrace-app`, and the reverse. Delete the tokens afterwards.
- Before the first real deploy: the real staging token fails to deploy to the prod workspace.
- Net out-of-pocket Modal spend stays at $0 until launch. Usage inside the free credit is expected.
- Revisit if the team needs per-person roles inside one workspace, if Starter limits (seats, GPU or container concurrency, storage) block us, or if spend makes Team worthwhile.

## Open questions

- Can both workspaces set a $0 spend limit on Starter, as the docs imply? Owner: @anthonythanpoovong, check **Usage & billing** in each, and record the answer here.
- Does `editrace-app` show the Starter plan and its own free credit, and is the credit per workspace or per account? Owner: @anthonythanpoovong.
- What are the Starter seat, GPU and container concurrency and storage limits for a four-person team? Owner: @anthonythanpoovong.
- Does the app call workers by URL or through the Modal client? Decides how much a staging move costs. Owner: @anthonythanpoovong.
