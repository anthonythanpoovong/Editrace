"""The cut worker (#7): PySceneDetect's AdaptiveDetector on the shared worker base (#53), as decided in ADR 0003.

The base fetches and checks the video, caches by content hash, version and params, stamps provenance, validates the
partial template against the schema, stores it and reports status. This class only says what to run.
