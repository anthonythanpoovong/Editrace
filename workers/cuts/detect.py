"""Cut detection core for the cut worker (#7): video in, cuts and slots out, as decided in ADR 0003.

PySceneDetect's AdaptiveDetector compares each frame's content change with the average change around it, so a cut
stands out even in footage that moves a lot. Every detected cut is kept; suspect ones are flagged for the user to
review, never deleted here.

This module doesn't depend on the shared worker base (#53). The worker's `detect()` calls `find_cuts()` and
`to_partial()`; the base adds provenance, validates the result and stores it.
